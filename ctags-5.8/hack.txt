And now, let's change to the source directory for our next step:

cd ctags-5.7

Step 2: Add ActionScript support to the cTags source:

Now we need to edit two files, source.mak and parsers.h to ensure that ctags knows what it needs to properly parse ActionScript code (Bonus tip: From a terminal window, you can launch files in jEdit by typing open -a jedit filename).

In source.mak, we need to add a line that says "actionscript.c \\" under SOURCES and "actionscript.$(OBJEXT) \\" under OBJECTS.

In parsers.h, we need to add the following line under #define PARSER_LIST:
ActionScriptParser, \\.

Step 3: Build the ctags binary from source

In the terminal window, make sure you are still in the ctags source directory (and that the actionscript.c you downloaded earlier is there, too) and type:

./configure

If everything works out, you should see a series of "checking forâ€¦" lines and eventually, you'll return to a command prompt (and no error messages). If you see error messages, check your work above and try, try again. Otherwise, go ahead and "make" the ctags application:

make
